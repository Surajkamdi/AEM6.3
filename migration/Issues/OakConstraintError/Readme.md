javax.jcr.nodetype.ConstraintViolationException: OakConstraint0001: /apps/founda
tion/components/test[[nt:folder]]: No matching definition found for child node
 dialog with effective type [cq:Dialog] (500)
 
 Solution1:
 ==========
 
 
 Sling:folder allows to override and use some components

Eg:

/apps/foundation if under foundation /test folder created and then if try to create dialog it shows error "Could not save changes. Received 409 (Conflict) for saving changes in workspace crx.default. OakConstraint0001: /apps/foundation/components/report[[nt:folder]]: No matching definition found for child node dialog with effective type [cq:Dialog]"

but if you make /test folder as sling:folder type and then create dialog it works fine.


 just add the folder as sling:folder.
 
 you can do by adding .context.xml inside /apps/foundation/components/test/.context.xml
 
 .context.xml

 Solution:
 ==========
 
   Symptom: When installing the AEM 6.0 package, the Package Manager logs the following error
  message: javax.jcr.nodetype.ConstraintViolationException:
  OakConstraint0001: /apps/cq/core/content/nav/tools[[nt:folder]]: No
  matching definition found for child node ctc with effective type
  [nt:unstructured]. The Package Manager then aborts the installation.
  Cause: This occurs when the /apps/cq/core/ node tree already exists with non-matching
  node types. For example, this occurs if the ACS AEM Commons package is already installed.
  Resolution: Ensure that when overlaying nodes, the node types under /apps/cq/core
  mirror those from /libs/cq/core.
  
  
      If the ACS AEM Commons package is already installed, perform the following steps:
    1. On CRXDE, navigate to /apps/cq/core/content/nav.
    2. Rename the tools folder to tools-ctcbackup.
    3. Install the Clay Tablet package. For detailed instructions, refer to the Clay Tablet Connector
    for Adobe Experience Manager Installation and Configuration Guide.
    4. After installing the Clay Tablet package, return to CRXDE.
    5. Copy the child nodes under /apps/cq/core/content/nav/tools-ctcbackup/ to
    /apps/cq/core/content/nav/tools.
    6. Delete /apps/cq/core/content/nav/tools-ctcbackup/.
    This should replace the existing tools nodetype, which presumably had been set to
    nt:folder, with nt:unstructured.
